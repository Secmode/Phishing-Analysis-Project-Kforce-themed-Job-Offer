# Phishing Investigation: Malicious Job Offer & MITRE Mapping

## üîπ Overview

This project documents a real-world phishing email I received in Gmail that impersonates a **hiring manager** and asks the recipient to complete an external **‚Äúbackground report.‚Äù** The goal is to preserve evidence, extract indicators-of-compromise (IOCs), analyze the email‚Äôs delivery and social-engineering techniques, and produce a clear, reproducible forensic workflow that can be shown in a GitHub portfolio.

## Observation

I received a **‚ÄúCongratulations ‚Äî You Have Been Selected‚Äù** job-offer email that immediately asked me to complete a **background check.** While the spelling and grammar appeared correct, the message used premature praise (‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù) and requested an external background check ‚Äî a known **social-engineering tactic** designed to prompt quick compliance.  

The included link pointed to a tracked redirect URL, consistent with **credential/PII harvesting scams**. I did not interact with the link on my production machine. Instead, I saved the full raw message, opened it in **Sublime Text** for review, and performed all further analysis in an **isolated lab VM** to safely investigate the redirect and extract IOCs.

## Raw Email Analysis (Sublime Text)

## Breakdown of the suspicious elements found in the raw email:
### Mismatch in Identity
Email is sent from `@consultant.com` but claims to be from **Kforce Inc.**  
- **Domain reputation checks:**  
  - VirusTotal flagged the domain as suspicious (3/95 security vendors).   **AND**  urlscan.io showed the IP address resolving to `185.158.133.1` (Frankfurt am Main, Germany), which does **not** match the U.S.-based infrastructure typically used by Kforce.

### Social Engineering ‚Äî Premature Praise And Suspicious Background Check Request
- **Subject line:** **‚ÄúCongratulations!** You Have Been Selected for Kforce Inc‚Äù.
   This creates urgency and excitement before any real interview process ‚Äî a classic social engineering hook **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping ID: T1598** ‚Äì Phishing (general)

### Phishing Link with Redirect
**Classic URL obfuscation and redirection.**
- Google SafeRedirect ‚Üí Actual pointing to a suspicious Malicious destination website flagged by multiple security platforms.

### Header Analysis ‚Äî Pass but Suspicious
- **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC pass**, but only for consultant.com.
This means the email is technically authenticated, but for the wrong domain ‚Äî confirming **domain misuse / business impersonation.**

### Originating IP Address
 - **Mismatch between mail.com webmail (client) location Bangladesh Jhenida and claimed company location.**
- Received: from mout.mail.com (mout.mail.com. [74.208.4.201]) by mx.google.com ... **Role: This is the sending mail server‚Äôs IP ‚Äî the server that tried to deliver the email to Gmail.**
- Received: from [103.76.241.19] ([103.76.241.19]) by web-mail.mail.com ... **Role: This is the originating client IP ‚Äî the device that actually composed or submitted the email.**
